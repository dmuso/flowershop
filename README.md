# The Flowershop

This program will calculate the number and types of bundles for 
incoming flower orders.


## Prerequisites

-   *Ruby v2.1.0*. Older versions of Ruby 1.9+ should work fine, although 
    they haven't been tested.
-   *RSpec v2.14.1*.  RSpec is required to run the test suite.
-   *RVM*. RVM is optional but support has been added for specific ruby
    versioning and a dedicated gemset.


## Configuration

Configuration options are specified in the `config` folder.  There are
a number of configration options that you can set:

-   `product_range.yml`. This file lists the flower product range, pricing
    and bundle combinations.


## Running the program

## Running the tests

This program also includes a full test suite that you can use to verify
the behaviour of the program and examples of how to run the program
effectively.  The testing suite will require`rspec` to run.

To run the test scripts, run `rspec` in the program directory.
